# playbook - Ansible Playbooks (new organization)
A collection of Ansible playbooks developed.  New structure has been created:
- [ansible-playbooks](https://github.com/bonovoxly/playbook/tree/master/ansible-playbooks) directory - containers folders of playbooks.
- [ansible-roles](https://github.com/bonovoxly/playbook/tree/master/ansible-roles) directory - all shared roles.

Credentials are stored in an Ansible vault, usually in `vars/{{ env }}_aws/vault.yml`.  Vault file is not uploaded.

Ansible playbooks:
- **[bastionhost](https://github.com/bonovoxly/playbook/blob/master/ansible-playbooks/bastionhost.yml)** - A playbook that creates a bastion host, allowing SSH access to private instances within a VPC ([blog post here](http://bonovoxly.github.io/2016-07-05-bastion-host-private-vpc-aws)).
- **[openvpn](https://github.com/bonovoxly/playbook/blob/master/ansible-playbooks/openvpn.yml)** - A playbook that creates an personal OpenVPN server.

- **[vpc_create](https://github.com/bonovoxly/playbook/blob/master/ansible-playbooks/vpc_create.yml)** - A playbook that creates a VPC, with associated subnets and routes. Note, this may conflict with the `bastionhost` playbook, as that requires interaction with AWS routing.

- **[another kubernetes playbook](https://github.com/bonovoxly/playbook/blob/master/ansible-playbooks/kubernetes.yml)** - A playbook that configures a Kubernetes stack deployed via Terraform ([blog post here](http://bonovoxly.github.io/2017-02-27-another-terraform-ansible-kubernetes)).
- **[stuffs](https://github.com/bonovoxly/playbook/blob/master/ansible-playbooks/stuffs.yml)** - A playbook that gathers inventory data on all instances and generates a static web page inventory using Hugo ([Blog post here](http://bonovoxly.github.io/2017-03-14-stuffs-inventory-tool)).
